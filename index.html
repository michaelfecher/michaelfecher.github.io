						<h2 class="major" style="text-align: left;">End-to-End System Design and Implementation</h2>
						<p style="text-align: left;">
							I help to design and to implement distributed software systems in the AWS Cloud to deliver
							your business strategy to your customers. <br />Guidance and responsibility for the whole
							software-lifecycle is also one of my specialties.
							<br>I always aim for feasible solutions starting from the data ingestion
							over improving user experiences to operational excellence.
							<br>Therefore, I don't prefer to work with Kubernetes in terms of feasibility (high
							operational costs, high risks due to complexity).
							<br>I focus on serverless code and managed services by AWS instead.
							<br>Additionally, I believe in Infrastructure-as-Code with a programming language.
							This is possible with the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK), which I've been using since
							2018 (Developer Preview).
							<br>In previous projects, I was successfully driving the design and development of IoT
							platforms, legacy migrations towards the cloud and Software-as-a-Service projects.
							<br>
							With this gained knowledge in various domains and due to my value-oriented, structured and
							transparent way of working,
							I can tackle requirements of every size and bring them to life.

						<h2 class="major">Servant Leadership</h2>
						<p>Thanks to my project management and technical lead experiences, I coach and mentor
							dev teams to be more "successful" and that each person is capable of looking
							behind the tech horizon.
							<br>With my coachings, I aim for individual goals, tolerance, inclusion, responsibility, and
							an overall better shape in life as well as on work related things.
							<br>This is what I call a "holistic engineer".
